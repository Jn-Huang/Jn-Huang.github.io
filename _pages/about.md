I am Jin Huang, a rising senior student majoring in Computer Science at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am interested in research on various topics related to deep learning for graphs, interpretable artificial intelligence (AI), and the integration of Large Language Model (LLM) in these areas. 

I am a research intern at [Foreseer Group](http://foreseer.si.umich.edu), advised by [Qiaozhu Mei](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/) and [Jiaqi Ma](https://www.jiaqima.com). During 2023 summer, I work with [Danai Koutra](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/) on OOD problems in link prediciton. 

I also hold a dual degree of Electronic and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I worked with [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com).
