Hi! I am Jin Huang, a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan, advised by Professor [Qiaozhu Mei](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/). I am interested in various topics including LLMs for scientific discovery, data attribution and graph ML.

Previouly, I received bachelor degrees from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During my undergrad, I am also fortunate to work with Professor [Jiaqi Ma](https://www.jiaqima.com) and Professor [Danai Koutra](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/). I interned at DP Technology and Intel.

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies. As Edward Yang put it, "we live three times as long since man invented movies." I owe my gratitude to the late-night series at [Michigan Theatre](https://marquee-arts.org/state-theatre/), just a two-minute walk from my office.
