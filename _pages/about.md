Hi! I am Steven (Jin) Huang, a first-year year Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan in the [Foreseer Group](https://umich-foreseer.github.io), advised by Prof. [Qiaozhu Mei](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/). My research interests include large language models (LLMs) for scientific discovery, data attribution, and graph machine learning.

Previously, I completed bachelor's degree at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I've also had the privilege of working with Prof. [Jiaqi Ma](https://www.jiaqima.com) and Prof. [Danai Koutra](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/). I interned at DP Technology and Intel.

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies. As Edward Yang put it, "we live three times as long since man invented movies." I owe my gratitude to the late-night series at the [State Theatre](https://marquee-arts.org/state-theatre/). I was born and raised in Nanking.
