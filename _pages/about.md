Hi! I am Jin Huang, a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan, advised by Professor [Qiaozhu Mei](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/). I am interested in various topics including graph ML, LLMs for scientific discovery and explainable ML.

Previouly, I received bachelor degrees in CS from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and in ECE from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During my undergrad, I am also fortunate to work with Professor [Jiaqi Ma](https://www.jiaqima.com) and Professor [Danai Koutra](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/). I interned at DP Technology and Intel.
