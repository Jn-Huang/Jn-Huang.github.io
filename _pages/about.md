I am Jin Huang, a junior student majoring in Computer Science at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research interest lies in graph neural networks and interpretable AI. I am a research intern at [Foreseer Group](http://foreseer.si.umich.edu), advised by [Qiaozhu Mei](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/) and [Jiaqi Ma](https://www.jiaqima.com). I also hold a dual degree of Electronic and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I worked with [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com).
