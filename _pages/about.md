I am Jin Huang, a junior student majoring in Computer Science at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research interest lies in graph neural networks and interpretable AI. I am an research intern at [Foreseer Group](http://foreseer.si.umich.edu), advised by [Qiaozhu Mei](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/). I also hold a dual degree of Electronic and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I worked with [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com).

I am looking for research opportunities for 2023 Summer. Please feel free to contact me if you have any openings!
