I will attend NeurIPS 2024 from December 10 to 16 and present at FM4Science Workshop; looking forward to connecting and discussing AI research! Paper: [SciLitLLM: How to Adapt LLMs for Scientific Literature Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15545), Project: [SciLitLLM](https://scilitllms.github.io).
